        <strong>Decoding Binary</strong><br>
        <span>Implemented validation methods to ensure correct values were input. Decodes 34 bit binary sequence using a predetermined pattern. Reads from a file containing binary sequences and outputs re-formatted data into a separate text file.</span>
      </li>

        <strong>MiniCheckers</strong><br>
        <span>Designed program MiniCheckers which simulates a simplified version of checkers. Game has options of player vs player or player vs AI computer.
